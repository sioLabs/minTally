	Today I have to work on the the View Customer. First I am going to set
	all the customer in the simple list. The search functionality will not be
	there and it will added as an issue of enhancement.

	There is no message that the item is saved sucessfully.

	Also there are 2 reults per save. One contains the Value and One is empty
	Also the viewer shows the wrong bill no. Why is that. The SaleBill no is correct in the
	database but wrong in the viewer. On restarting the System, it shows the correct
	bill number but the customer name is not there. It may due to the customer name is not set
	in the SaleBill Class.  

	Now the viewer is getting the Customer Name. Next Problem is why there are 2 saves.
	One with whole value and one empty.:
	I did a cascade.Merge. This is now throwing an Exception. I think the problem is here
	only as a new object is created by a Child Object.

	Back to square one. The Items are saving but 2 times.
	Solved the problem. I was creating a new SaleBill item and that was the problem.


=======================================================================================
	The new SaleBill number that is generated is one less. Corrected It

	I downloaded a minTally Software. BusyWIn. It will help as a guide to what to develop 
	finally. I will make a feature list from this software and then implement this in my 
	program.

	1. Create a Company should be the first option.
	2. Create a Super User
	3. Now there are Features and Options. Screen 3

	This is good. They have planned everything and now I just have to find the logic for it
	also create the UI like them. I will see there db structure and then design our db like 
	them only
	
	I have to create a textbox like the search box in the ensemble. On typing in the text box 
	the items will come and add automatically. So I have to look into the customized TableView
	also.
